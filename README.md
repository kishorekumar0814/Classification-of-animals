# Cat-Dog Image Classifier

Welcome to the Cat-Dog Image Classifier project! This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. Whether you're a pet enthusiast or a machine learning enthusiast, this project provides an exciting opportunity to explore image recognition using modern deep learning models.

## Overview

This project consists of a deep learning model trained on a dataset of cat and dog images. The model is capable of distinguishing between cats and dogs in input images with remarkable accuracy. By leveraging the power of neural networks, the classifier can automatically learn and extract relevant features from raw image data, making it a robust solution for image classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the classifier consists of thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs. It is divided into two main folders: one for training and another for testing. Each folder contains subfolders corresponding to the two classes: cats and dogs. This meticulously curated dataset ensures that the model learns to generalize well and achieve high performance on unseen data.

**Note:** Due to the size limitations of GitHub repositories, the dataset is uploaded as Zip files make unzip it while executing. However, you can easily obtain similar datasets from various online sources or create your own dataset for experimentation. This project done purely bases on Education purpose only.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/cat-dog-image-classifier.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Classifier:** Run the classifier script and provide the path to the input image you want to classify.
    ```
    python classify_image.py path/to/input_image.jpg
    ```
   The classifier will display the input image along with the classification result (cat or dog) and the confidence percentage.
